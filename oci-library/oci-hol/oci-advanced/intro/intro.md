# Introduction

In this workshop, you will create two compute instances and two virtual cloud networks and configure networking peering between them.

Estimated time: 60 minutes

## About Virtual Cloud Network Peering

VCN peering is the process of connecting multiple virtual cloud networks (VCNs). There are two types of VCN peering:

- Local VCN peering (within region)
- Remote VCN peering (across regions)

You can use VCN peering to divide your network into multiple VCNs (for example, based on departments or lines of business), with each VCN having direct, private access to the others. There's no need for traffic to flow over the internet or through your on-premises network by way of an IPSec VPN or FastConnect. You can also place shared resources into a single VCN that all the other VCNs can access privately.

Because remote VCN peering crosses regions, you can use it (for example) to mirror or back up your databases in one region to another.
